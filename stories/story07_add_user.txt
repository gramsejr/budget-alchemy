Create a script or application that uses the models that we have created to add/modify a user.

You should prompt the user for the account info to add a new user.

If the user gives you the correct password for the user_name, let them change the info on that user.

Example user:
"user_name": "grub",
"first_name": "Worm",
"middle_name": "R",
"last_name": "Sauce",
"password": "password"

*Note: You may want to add a few methods to the User model, that is fine go ahead.
