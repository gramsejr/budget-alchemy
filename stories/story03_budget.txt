Create the Budget class that represents the budgets table in the database diagram. Should contain these columns:
id Integer PK
group_id Integer FK to budget_groups
name varchar(64) not null
budget_amount_in_cents = Integer

Also create a property "budget_amount" that will return / set budget_amount_in_cents as a dollar amount.
Set the __str__ and __repr__ methods to pretty print the object.
